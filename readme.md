I made a page that is dedicated to car enthusiasts where they can create a meet at any time
and delete one at any time.

Home Page:
Home, Create Meet, Upcoming meet tabs all functionally work and you can switch to any page you like.

The create meet button also works which brings you to the create meet page

The social media boxicons/icons work. They are linked to all four social media home pages.

Create Meet page:
Everything does work. There are 5 enter text boxes, 1 date selection and the other a drop down.
Everything is required to fill out except for the comments box.

Once you click the Sign up button and there are no errors(hopefully) Click on the upcoming meets
tab and it will display all the information you put in.

Upcoming meets page:
All information will be displayed under upcoming meets.
It starts out with event name, Location, vehicle, car category, message, organizer, event date,
as well as the date it was posted on by that user

If you dont want to see the information you can click the delete button. The information will delete and bring you back to the create meet page.

LIMITATIONS:
When deleting a meet in upcoming meets page it can only delete 4-5 before crashing.
restarting in the terminal fixes that problem.

This is hit or miss but sometimes as I didn't have a problem before. There is an error that wont let you delete the very last data entry for a meet

All meet creations do show up but the newest one shows up at the bottom than the top.
I dont know if thats a bad thing as the real meetup.com page does the same thing.

If you leave the page on too long it will expire and crash. you will need to restart the node.

For the createmeets page: you have to put in all the information required. I wanted to be an optional but I ran into so many bugs it would take too long to list. Only the comment box is optional

Lastly I wanted a notification that you let you know the meet was created successfully but that also created problems so I had to remove it.
